# Creating Criterias

Criterias must be added and updated from the Work Item control.

## Approvers

Approvers can be added as individual users or groups. When a group is added as the approver only a single member of the group is required to process it.

## Important note about data storage

Data related to acceptance criterias are not stored together with the data for the work item. This means that all changes to acceptance criterias are immidiate. If you make changes to a work item and acceptance criteria and then discards the changes to the work item, the data for acceptance criterias are NOT discarded.
