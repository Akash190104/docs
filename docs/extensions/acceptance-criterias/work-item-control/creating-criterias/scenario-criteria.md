# Scenario Criteria

Scenario oriented criterias follows the _Given/When/Then_ sequence and allows you to setup a scenario for the criteria. The GWT sequence would look something like:

- _Given_ some prediction
- _When_ I do some action
- _Then_ I exepect some result

This extension also adds a _And_ sequence element.

Both the `Title`, `Description`, `Scenario` and at least one sequnce element is required for scenario criterias.

Sequence elements can be moved up and down, as well as deleted. Changing the type of a sequence element is currently not supported.
